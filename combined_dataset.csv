"Arrival Order: Amanda, Nick, Jubilee, Evan, Vinny, Carly, Grant, Daniel, Sarah, Emily & Haley, Izzy, Lace, Jared, Chad.

Chris Harrison informs that, just like last season, if Emily receives a rose Haley will stay, and vice versa. Jubilee receives the first date card of the season and asked Jared on a date. They went on a dinner date and got to know each other. Meanwhile, Lace, Chad, and Grant go to the bar and Lace and Chad make out in private. Suddenly, Chad becomes belligerent and argues with Lace. Chad starts to show more aggressive behavior towards the other contestants, especially Izzy and Sarah. Chad later got drunk, and then passed out on the beach. Harrison, at the end of his rope, removes Chad from paradise, and Chad refuses to apologize to the other contestants. Harrison pushes Chad out the door, with Chad shouting expletives at him. The episode ends with ""To Be Continued...""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

"After saying ""Fuck you Chris Harrison"", Chad finally leaves paradise, much to everyone's relief. Leah arrives with a date card, planning to ask Chad out on a date. After being informed that Chad was eliminated, she was dismayed, but asked Nick out instead.  They go to a fair, where she kisses him, which she thought was great but Nick thinks Leah is nuts. Shortly after returning from their date, Nick was given a date card of his own and he asked Amanda out, which upset Leah, who thought their date had gone well. At the rose ceremony, Grant gave his rose to Lace, Nick gave his rose to Amanda [much to Leah's annoyance.] Vinny gave his rose to Izzy, Evan (very enthusiastically) gives his rose to Carly, Jared saves Haley from elimination by giving his rose to Emily, upsetting Jubilee, a Daniel gives the last rose to Sarah, claiming ""He saved the best for last."" Leah and Jubilee were eliminated. A day later, Josh Murray, the winner of The Bachelorette, from Andi's season then arrived with a date card and asked Amanda out, which meant that he and Nick were competing for the same woman, much as they had competed for Andi Dorfman. They went sailing on a yacht and they get to know each other. They end the day making out. Meanwhile, Lace and Grant hooked up, and Evan kissed Carly, which he thought was fantastic but she decidedly did not. Later Evan was given a date card and he asked Carly out, to her dismay. They set a new world's record for the longest kiss after eating a habanero pepper, which Carly did not enjoy at all, and she starts throwing up in the restroom.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

"As Josh and Amanda spend the day making out, Christian Bishop from JoJo's season arrives with a date card and asks Sarah out. She has mixed feelings about this since Daniel had just given her a rose, but she agrees and has a great time. Carly breaks the news to Evan that she wants to be a friend but is not romantically interested in him, much to his devastation. Brandon Andreen from Desiree's season arrives with a date card and briefly considers Carly, but asks Haley out instead. He tells Haley that he is sure that he could tell her and Emily apart, and to test this they switch places mid-date. Brandon fails to recognize Emily, and is about to kiss her, but she stops him. Sarah meets with Daniel and they get to know each other better. Evan, feeling down about getting dumped, broods for a long time and decides that he needs to make a bold move, and approaches Amanda and Josh, with a handmade date card that says ""Evan, you deserve love.""",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

"Evan approaches Amanda and Josh with a handmade date card, and takes Amanda aside for a chat. He expresses his feelings for her and she says she wishes he had said something sooner, but she is with Josh now. She then cries because she pities Evan, who thinks that they have a small connection. The twins note that Brandon never did detect their mid-date switch. Before the Rose Ceremony, Evan takes Amanda aside again and tells her that Andi Dorfman wrote a book that told of verbal abuse from Josh, and advised caution. Word of this quickly got back to Josh and he had a talk with Evan, and said that the book was fictional. Meanwhile, Nick was also advising Amanda to be cautious. At the Rose Ceremony, Amanda gave her rose Josh, and Carly gave her rose to Evan. Sarah, Izzy, and Lace give their roses to Daniel, Vinny, and Grant. Emily gives her rose to Jared, and Haley gives the last rose to Nick even though she is seeing him as a friend, sending a dismayed Brandon home, and also Christian was sent home. Caila arrived with a date card and asked Jared out. Lace and Izzy were given a ""double date"" card and they asked Grant and Vinny out. Later Evan did not appear to be well and a medic was called.

The only guy who is not in a relationship is Daniel, so Sarah, Haley and Ashley approach him to try to earn his rose. At the Rose Ceremony, Daniel gives his rose to Haley, so Sarah and Ashley are sent home. But Ashley tells the driver to let her out and she returns to paradise and asks for a second chance, and all agree. Evan was still with Carly and he said it was the best injury he ever faked. Carl and Brett arrive with double date cards, and they ask Caila and Emily out. Caila is indecisive but finally decides to go, and does not have a good time on the 'booze cruise'. She returns to a relieved Jared. Izzy was instantly attracted to Brett when he arrived and starts to question her relationship with Vinny. Grant takes Lace to another part of the resort for a couples' massage, to deepen their relationship. Ryan B arrives with a date card. Jared tries to encourage him to ask Ashley out but he does not. Izzy tells Brett and then Vinny that she is only feeling ""75%"" for Vinny and wants to feel ""100%"" for someone. Vinny is hurt by this and considers leaving.

After interviewing all of the couples, they select Jared and Caila (to Ashley's dismay). Lace thinks that their interview went badly and starts to question her relationship with Grant. After Jared and Caila return, Ashley takes Jared aside and advises caution since Ashley questions the genuineness of Caila's feelings. Jared takes this back to Caila which upsets her, both because Ashley is questioning her feelings and because Jared seems to trust Ashley more than Caila.
