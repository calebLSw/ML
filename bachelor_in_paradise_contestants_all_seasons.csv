Rose Ceremony: Michelle and Cody exchanged roses and left as a couple. Marcus proposed to Lacy and she accepted.

"After saying ""Fuck you Chris Harrison"", Chad finally leaves paradise, much to everyone's relief. Leah arrives with a date card, planning to ask Chad out on a date. After being informed that Chad was eliminated, she was dismayed, but asked Nick out instead.  They go to a fair, where she kisses him, which she thought was great but Nick thinks Leah is nuts. Shortly after returning from their date, Nick was given a date card of his own and he asked Amanda out, which upset Leah, who thought their date had gone well. At the rose ceremony, Grant gave his rose to Lace, Nick gave his rose to Amanda [much to Leah's annoyance.] Vinny gave his rose to Izzy, Evan (very enthusiastically) gives his rose to Carly, Jared saves Haley from elimination by giving his rose to Emily, upsetting Jubilee, a Daniel gives the last rose to Sarah, claiming ""He saved the best for last."" Leah and Jubilee were eliminated. A day later, Josh Murray, the winner of The Bachelorette, from Andi's season then arrived with a date card and asked Amanda out, which meant that he and Nick were competing for the same woman, much as they had competed for Andi Dorfman. They went sailing on a yacht and they get to know each other. They end the day making out. Meanwhile, Lace and Grant hooked up, and Evan kissed Carly, which he thought was fantastic but she decidedly did not. Later Evan was given a date card and he asked Carly out, to her dismay. They set a new world's record for the longest kiss after eating a habanero pepper, which Carly did not enjoy at all, and she starts throwing up in the restroom.",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

She has mixed feelings about this since Daniel had just given her a rose, but she agrees and has a great time. Carly breaks the news to Evan that she wants to be a friend but is not romantically interested in him, much to his devastation. Brandon Andreen from Desiree's season arrives with a date card and briefly considers Carly, but asks Haley out instead.

He expresses his feelings for her and she says she wishes he had said something sooner, but she is with Josh now. She then cries because she pities Evan, who thinks that they have a small connection. The twins note that Brandon never did detect their mid-date switch. Before the Rose Ceremony, Evan takes Amanda aside again and tells her that Andi Dorfman wrote a book that told of verbal abuse from Josh, and advised caution. Word of this quickly got back to Josh and he had a talk with Evan, and said that the book was fictional. Meanwhile, Nick was also advising Amanda to be cautious. At the Rose Ceremony, Amanda gave her rose Josh, and Carly gave her rose to Evan. Sarah, Izzy, and Lace give their roses to Daniel, Vinny, and Grant.
